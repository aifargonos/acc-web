Timezone
	
	Uses UTC even when USE_TZ = False !!!
	Probably because server time is in UTC .: check settings of nginx :-P
	
	Simply set the timezone in the settings :-P
		Check out how it really works .:
			create records under both settings
			export the database and check the data
			import different data and view it under the both settings
			
			datetime is stored in the database in UTC
		So the setting TIME_ZONE shall be the time zone in which I work, when I travel, I change it
		And all the datetimes shall be stored in UTC, so they'll be objective :-P



export the old database and import it into the new one



make the dev docker work with port 8080
	
	redirects always ifnore the port
